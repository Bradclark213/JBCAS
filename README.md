## Requirements

To see all placed objects, users must have the same libraries installed that were used when building JBCAS.  
This package only contains my airport/scenery BGLs and config files – **no third-party models or textures are included.**

**Payware libraries (not included, user must own):**  
Any and all payware libraries used within the scenery must be purchased and installed separately by the user.  
If you don’t own a given payware package, the related objects simply won’t appear in your sim.

**Freeware libraries (not included):**  
This scenery also uses several freeware object libraries. These must be downloaded and installed separately by the user.  
A detailed list of recommended freeware and payware libraries will be added later (and/or on the Flightsim.to page) once finalized.


## Installation

1. Download the latest JBCAS release `.zip` from the **Releases** section.
2. Extract it.
3. Copy the included JBCAS scenery folders into your **MSFS 2024 Community** folder.
4. Make sure any **required payware/freeware libraries** listed above are installed.
5. Launch MSFS 2024 and select **KNAV – Joint Base Cabot Air Station**.
